      <p>Are you interested in giving a talk at <a
          href="http://www.uxburlington.com">UX Burlington 2016</a>?
        The conference takes place on April 29<sup>th</sup> in
        Burlington, Vermont. It is a single-track conference with seven 30-minute
        talks. The expected audience is 150 people, and we are looking
        for four to five additional speakers to join the invited speakers.</p>
      <p>
        The theme of the conference is <strong>"What it really takes to build a great user experience on the web"</strong>.
        We are interested in talks that appeal to a broad audience of web designers,
        developers, authors, and anyone who is passionate about a great user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check out <a href='https://vimeo.com/album/3447854'>videos from last year's event</a>
        for an idea of the types of talks we are looking for. Keep in mind that we want the event
        to be unique each year, so we will favor submissions that are different than years past.
      </p>
      <p>The process for selecting speakers starts with an anonymous review, where the
        top 20 proposals are selected based solely on their abstracts. From
        there, we will pick our favorites that we think are the best fit for the
        conference.</p>
      <p>If you are interested in speaking, submit <strong>up to three</strong> proposals.
        Edit and delete submissions up until the date when the CFP closes
        (<%= ApplicationHelper::CutoffDate %>). Lastly, all of the information you
        enter will be used on the site if you are selected to speak. Be sure to
        check for typos!</p>
      <p>All speakers receive free admission to the conference. We will also provide
        lodging and travel assistance to speakers as needed. However, in an effort to
        keep ticket prices low, we are unable to pay speaking fees.
        </p>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to submit a proposal or few. We really
        appreciate it. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out to
        us <a href="mailto:info@uxburlington.com">by email</a> or <a
