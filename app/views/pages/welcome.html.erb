      <p>Are you interested in giving a talk at <a
          href="http://www.uxburlington.com">UX Burlington 2017</a>?
        The conference takes place on June 8<sup>th</sup>-9<sup>th</sup>, 2017 in Burlington, Vermont, 
        a celebrated, vibrant, small city located on the eastern shoreline of Lake Champlain. 
        It is a two-day, single-track conference with seven 30-minute
        talks. The expected audience is 200 people, and we are looking
        for five additional speakers to join the invited speakers. UX Burlingtion is celebrating its third year! 
        Weâ€™ve attracted speakers and attendees from around the world and our speakers will be selected 
        by a diverse committee of volunteers, with an anonymous first round of judging. 
        The event is hosted by Maureen McElaney and Emily Piper.</p>
      <p>
        The theme of the conference is <strong>"What it really takes to build a great user experience on the web"</strong>.
        We are interested in talks that appeal to a broad audience of web designers,
        developers, authors, researchers, and anyone who is passionate about a great user experience. 
        Talks should be 30-minute in length on both technical and community topics related to User Experience. 
        This means anything from web, mobile, and back end systems that improve UX on the web to talks about 
        research, accessibility, team communication, increasing inclusivity and diversity in tech.
      </p>

        Check out talks from <a href="https://vimeo.com/album/4035061" target="_blank">2016</a> 
        and <a href="https://vimeo.com/album/3447854" target="_blank">2015</a>
        for an idea of the types of talks we are looking for. We want the event
        to be unique each year, so we will favor submissions that are different than years past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that many attendees will not be user experience experts.
        Proposals should be clear and concise. Less than 200 words is ideal, but we will accept
        proposals of any length. Give us a high level summary of your talk, and leave the details for the conference.
      </p>
      <p>Your proposals will be anonymized in the first round of judging and will be selected by our selection 
        committee, which is made up of a diverse panel of volunteers. After the anonymous review, the
        top 25 proposals are selected based solely on their abstracts. From
        there, we will pick our favorites that we think are the best fit for the
        conference.</p>
      <p>If you are interested in speaking, submit <strong>up to three</strong> proposals.
        Edit and delete submissions up until the date when the CFP closes
        (<%= ApplicationHelper::CutoffDate %>). Lastly, all of the information you
        enter will be used on the site if you are selected to speak. Be sure to
        check for typos!</p>
      <p>All speakers receive free admission to the conference. We will also provide
        lodging and travel assistance to speakers as needed. However, in an effort to
        keep ticket prices low, we are unable to pay speaking fees.
        </p>

        appreciate it. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out to
