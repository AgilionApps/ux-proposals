      <p>Are you interested in giving a talk at <a
          href="http://uxburlington.com">UX Burlington 2015 Conference</a>?
        The conference takes place on June 12<sup>th</sup> in
        Burlington, Vermont. It is a single-track conference with seven 30-minute
        talks. The expected audience is 150 people, and we are looking
        for four or five additional speakers to join the invited speakers.</p>
      <p>
        We are looking for talks that appeal to a broad audience of web designers,
        developers, authors, and anyone who is passionate about a great user experience.
      </p>
      <p>The process for selecting speakers starts with a blind review, where the
        the top 20 proposals are selected based solely on their abstracts. From
        there, we will pick our favorites that we think are the best fit for the
        conference.</p>
      <p>If you are interested in speaking, submit as many proposals as you would
        like. Edit and delete submissions up until the date when the CFP closes
        (<%= ApplicationHelper::CutoffDate %>). Lastly, all of the information you
        enter will be used on the site if you are selected to speak. Be sure to
        check for typos!</p>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to submit a proposal or few. We really
        appreciate it. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out to
        us <a href="mailto:pete@agilion.com">by email</a> or <a
          href="https://twitter.com/uxburlington">on Twitter</a>.</p>
